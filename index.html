With the American political climate at a boiling point ahead of the 2024 presidential election, it helps to gain some historical perspective.
Here, we view historical data sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/political-polarization-in-us-congress/data on US Congress political polarization.
Political ideology scores are calculated using DW-Nominate (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method))
We can observe that political polarization is currently at a peak in both the House and Senate chambers.
