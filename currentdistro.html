With the historical context we now have, here we break down ideology from 2021 to see the current state of political division
in the US Congress. "Moderate" congressmen, defined as having NOMINATE scores between -0.25 and 0.25 make up small minorities
of bouth the House and Senate, although we can observe that the Democratic party has more moderates than the Republican party,
and the Senate has more moderates than the House.
